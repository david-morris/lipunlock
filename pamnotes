it looks like my pam config will have something like this:
auth sufficient pam_py.c pam_droid.py

Will I need a password group item?
should I look in /etc/pam.d/system-auth?

Making the syncing app pam-aware will let me set up a rolling code asking the user
for auth, but not insisting the user enter their password --- or requiring that they

have one.
