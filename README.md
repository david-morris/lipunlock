#Lipunlock Auth
with the power of speech, use your phone as an authentication factor!
**This isn't ready yet.**  If you use this software as is, you will be cracked.
Developers: this is a PAM module.

##Todo 
1. Add an X509 cert on the computer to verify that an attacker isn't talking to the phone side.
2. Get the android app in the repo (it's already built.).
3. Add a beep on the android app
4. Make the android app just start listening instead of asking you to press a button.
5. Testing
5. Make a makefile after all those things have been done.
6. Add timing, so that the synchronicity of the app does not depend on the network speed.

##Installation Instructions:
**Don't.**

##But I really want to use this!
Use pam_permit instead. Currently, it's just as secure.
